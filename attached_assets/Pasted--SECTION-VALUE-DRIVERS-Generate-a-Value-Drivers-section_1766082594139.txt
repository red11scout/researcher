## SECTION: VALUE DRIVERS

Generate a Value Drivers section with strict formatting. Follow this exact structure:

### HEADLINE BLOCK

**$[XX.X]M** in annual value. [X] use cases. [Y] Critical-priority for Q1.

[BLANK LINE REQUIRED]

---

### VALUE COMPOSITION

| Category | Value | Share |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Cost Reduction | $XX.XM | XX% |
| Cash Flow | $XX.XM | XX% |
| Revenue | $XX.XM | XX% |
| Risk Mitigation | $XX.XM | XX% |

**Strategic tilt:** [X]% operational efficiency vs [Y]% revenue/risk. Back-office dominates customer-facing [ratio].

[BLANK LINE REQUIRED]

---

### TOP OPPORTUNITIES

One block per use case. Order by value. Maximum 4.

**[Use Case Name]** — $[X.X]M
[One sentence: what it does → what value it unlocks. No jargon.]

**[Use Case Name]** — $[X.X]M
[Same pattern.]

**[Use Case Name]** — $[X.X]M
[Same pattern.]

[BLANK LINE REQUIRED]

---

### ⚠️ Portfolio Risk

**[Use Case ID]: [Name]** carries [X]% of total value.

| Risk Factor | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Effort Score | [X]/5 |
| Timeline | [X] months |
| Dependencies | [Core system integration, model validation, etc.] |

**If it fails:** [One sentence consequence—what breaks, what value is exposed]

**Mitigation:** [Phased rollout requirement or parallel run mandate]

[BLANK LINE REQUIRED]

### TOKEN ECONOMICS

| Use Case | Annual Token Cost | Annual Value | Return per $1 |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| [UC-XX] [Name] | $XXK | $X.XM | $XXX |
| [UC-XX] [Name] | $XXK | $X.XM | $XXX |
| [UC-XX] [Name] | $XXK | $X.XM | $XXX |

**Insight:** [One sentence—which pattern wins and why. "High-value, low-frequency workflows outperform high-volume operations by Xx."]

## FORMATTING RULES FOR THIS SECTION

1. HEADLINE: Total value bold and alone on first line
2. TABLES: Proper markdown with blank lines before and after—never inline
3. USE CASES: Each gets its own bold header with value callout
4. RISK SECTION: Must be standalone with ⚠️ marker—never buried in prose
5. TOKEN ECONOMICS: Always a table, never prose
6. BLANK LINES: Required between every distinct element
7. HORIZONTAL RULES (---): Separate each major subsection

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

❌ "**$52.4M** total annualized value across 10 AI use cases. Three Critical-priority initiatives capture $18.7M (36% of total value). Top opportunities: RM Productivity Accelerator delivers $9.5M..."
❌ Token costs buried in prose: "burns $177K annually at 450M monthly tokens"
❌ Critical risk starting mid-paragraph after ⚠️ emoji
❌ Value breakdown as inline parentheticals: "37% ($19.2M), followed by cash flow at 21% ($11.2M)"
❌ Asterisks showing instead of bold: **$52.4M**
