Back-office dominates customer-facing 8:2. TOP OPPORTUNITIES Regulatory Research Assistant — $52.8M AI-drafted compliance guidance with attorney review deflects 13,500 monthly questions and cuts misinterpretation incidents 70%. Unlocks $43.7M cost savings plus $9.1M risk reduction. Intelligent Data Mapping Copilot — $50.0M AI-conducted stakeholder interviews compress privacy data inventory from 800 consultant hours to 120 hours of validation. Saves $36.5M annually while accelerating implementation 90 days. Cross-Sell Intelligence Engine — $37.7M Daily product usage analysis surfaces expansion opportunities AEs can't see manually. Lifts cross-sell conversion 14 percentage points (8% to 22%) across 14,000 accounts for $30.4M new revenue. Churn Prediction & Intervention System — $32.8M Multi-signal churn prediction enables 90-day early intervention.

Risk Factor, Detail -------- Effort Score, 4/5 Timeline, 12 months Dependencies, Product telemetry integration, CRM data quality, payment system APIs, competitive intelligence feeds If it fails: $20.2M revenue retention opportunity lost. Customer success remains reactive. Churn insights stay siloed in individual CSM judgment. Mitigation: Phased rollout starting with 500-customer pilot in single vertical. Require 85% prediction accuracy threshold before full deployment. Run parallel manual health scoring for 6 months. TOKEN ECONOMICS Use Case, Annual Token Cost, Annual Value, Return per $1 ---------------------------------- UC-03 Regulatory Research, $680K, $52.8M, $78 UC-01 Data Mapping Copilot, $405K, $50.0M, $123 UC-04 Artifact Generator, $590K, $32.4M, $55 UC-02 Cross-Sell Intelligence, $795K, $37.7M, $47 UC-05 RFP Orchestrator, $68K, $16.7M, $246 Insight: High-value, low-frequency workflows outperform high-volume operations by 4x. RFP orchestration ($246 per $1) beats daily customer scoring ($1 per $1) because 350 enterprise deals justify deep context windows while 14,000 daily analyses require token-efficient models.
