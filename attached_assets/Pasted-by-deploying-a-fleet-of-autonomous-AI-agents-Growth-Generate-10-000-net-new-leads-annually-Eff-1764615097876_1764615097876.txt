Industry CPL: $350  vs.  Target CPL: $120

Industry Conversion: 5.58%  vs.  Target Conversion: 12%

Current State: The Friction

Manual processes create bottlenecks before the bid ever reaches the roof.

Slow "Speed to Lead": Inbound leads sit in CRM inboxes for hours. Industry data shows conversion drops 80% after 5 minutes.

Manual List Building: SDRs waste 40% of their time scraping permit sites and hail maps instead of selling.

Knowledge Gaps: Junior reps struggle to answer technical questions (TPO vs EPDM), losing credibility early.

The Solution: Platform 8

A unified AI Market Expansion Engine that automates the entire top-of-funnel workflow.

The Workflow

Ingest Data: System pulls from Hail maps, Permits, Property Records, and CRM Data.

AI Agents Act: Agents scout, qualify, personalize, and perform outreach 24/7.

Book Meeting: Agents negotiate time and book human estimators directly.

Handoff: Qualified leads enter Platform 1 (Sales Intelligence).

The Agent Fleet

The platform is orchestrated as a "Swarm" of specialized agents, each with a specific role.

The Scout (Data Agent): Continuously monitors new data sources (Hail, Permits). Triggers alerts when high-value targets appear (e.g., "Hail in Dallas"). Creates CRM leads.

The Hunter (Outbound Agent): Takes leads from The Scout. Generates hyper-personalized messages ("Saw your roof age is 20y..."). Executes multi-channel campaigns (Email, LinkedIn).

The Concierge (Inbound Agent): Lives on website/SMS. Qualifies inbound traffic 24/7. "Do you have a leak?" -> "Let me get a truck rolled." Instant response.

The Closer (Scheduling Agent): Accesses human estimator calendars. Negotiates times, sends invites, and handles rescheduling autonomously.

Fueling the Engine: Data Sources

The "Scout" agent requires real-time access to these proprietary data streams to identify triggers.

HailTrace / Interactive Hail Maps: Trigger "Emergency Service" campaigns immediately after storms.

ConstructConnect / Dodge Data: Trigger "New Roof" bids based on active permits and project starts.

CoStar / LoopNet: Trigger reroof opportunities based on property age >15y or transaction changes.

Private AI Architecture

We utilize a "Secure Enclave" approach to ensure Nations Roof's proprietary CRM data never leaks into public models.

Nations Roof CRM: Contains Proprietary Data (PII).

Trust Layer (The Shield): Performs PII Masking (e.g., changing "John Doe" to [CLIENT]) before data leaves the environment.

Local Vector DB (RAG): Stores technical knowledge locally for retrieval.

LLM (Reasoning): Processes logic only (No PII).

Architecture ensures compliance with SOC 2 and prevents data training leakage.
