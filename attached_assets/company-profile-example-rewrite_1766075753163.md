## BEFORE (Raw)

**COMPANY PROFILE** Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) is the world's largest home improvement retailer, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The company operates 2,335 retail stores across North America (United States, Canada, Mexico) and employs approximately 465,600 associates [HIGH CONFIDENCE - 2024 10-K]. For fiscal year 2024, Home Depot reported revenue of $152.7B with net earnings of $15.0B [HIGH CONFIDENCE - Q3 2024 earnings, annualized ×0.95 = $145.1B conservative estimate]. **KEY BUSINESS CHALLENGES** 1. **Inventory Optimization Complexity**: Managing $27.8B in inventory across 2,335+ locations with 1M+ SKUs creates significant carrying costs and stockout risks. DIY customer demand is highly seasonal and weather-dependent, while Pro customer demand requires predictable availability [HIGH CONFIDENCE - 10-K inventory figure]. 2. **Professional Customer (Pro) Growth**: Pro customers represent ~45% of revenue ($68.7B estimated) but require fundamentally different service models including job-site delivery, bulk ordering, and credit management. Current digital Pro penetration lags consumer segment [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - industry analyst reports]. 3. **Supply Chain Resilience**: 90% of products sourced internationally create vulnerability to disruptions. The company operates 200+ distribution facilities but faces challenges in last-mile delivery optimization and cross-dock efficiency [HIGH CONFIDENCE - 10-K supply chain disclosures]. 4. **Store Associate Productivity**: 465,600 associates across stores face repetitive customer questions, complex product knowledge requirements (50+ departments), and inefficient task switching between customer service and inventory management [ESTIMATED - based on store count and industry benchmarks]. 5. **Shrink and Loss Prevention**: Retail shrink estimated at 1.5-2.0% of revenue ($2.3-3.1B annually) driven by theft, damage, and administrative errors across massive store footprint [LOW CONFIDENCE - industry benchmark applied, not company-specific]. 6. **Real Estate Portfolio Optimization**: $40.8B in property and equipment requires continuous optimization decisions on store formats, relocation, and capital allocation across markets with changing demographics

## AFTER (Transformed)

### Company Profile

**Home Depot** | NYSE: HD | Atlanta, Georgia

**$152.7B** revenue. **$15.0B** net earnings. The world's largest home improvement retailer.

| Scale | |
|-------|---------|
| Stores | 2,335 across US, Canada, Mexico |

| Property | $40.8B in real estate |

### Key Business Challenges

**The $3B Problem: Shrink**  
Retail shrink runs 1.5–2.0% of revenue—potentially $3.1B walking out the door annually through theft, damage, and administrative error. Industry benchmark; company-specific data not disclosed.

**Pro Customer Paradox**  
Pro customers generate ~45% of revenue ($68.7B) but need a different business: job-site delivery, bulk ordering, credit management. Digital Pro penetration lags consumer. The margin opportunity is massive; the service gap is real.

**Inventory at Scale**  
$27.8B in inventory. 2,335 locations. 1M+ SKUs. DIY demand swings with seasons and weather. Pro demand requires guaranteed availability. Stockouts cost sales; overstock costs capital.

**Supply Chain Exposure**  
90% of products sourced internationally. 200+ distribution facilities. Vulnerability lives in the last mile—cross-dock efficiency and delivery optimization remain unsolved.

**Associate Productivity**  
465,600 people fielding repetitive questions across 50+ departments. Task-switching between customer service and inventory kills efficiency. The knowledge burden is unsustainable at scale.

**Real Estate Optimization**  
$40.8B in property requires continuous rebalancing—store formats, relocations, capital allocation—as demographics shift beneath the footprint.

## PRINCIPLES APPLIED

1. **Lead with consequence** — "The $3B Problem" not "Shrink and Loss Prevention"
2. **One paragraph, one job** — Each challenge is self-contained
3. **Numbers need space** — Bold callouts, line breaks, tables
4. **Translate jargon** — "walking out the door" not "retail shrink drivers"
5. **End with implication** — "unsustainable at scale" not restating the problem
