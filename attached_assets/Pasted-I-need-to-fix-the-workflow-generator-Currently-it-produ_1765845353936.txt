I need to fix the workflow generator. Currently it produces identical generic workflows for all use cases. 

The generateProcessSteps function must create UNIQUE workflows for each use case by analyzing:
1. The use case description
2. The target friction being solved
3. The business function (Sales, Compliance, Underwriting, etc.)

Here are the 10 use cases with their SPECIFIC workflow requirements:

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Update generateProcessSteps() to accept the use case object and generate steps based on:
   - useCase.description
   - useCase.targetFriction
   - useCase.function
   - useCase.subFunction

2. Use Claude API to generate contextual steps. The prompt should include the specific use case context and generate appropriate steps.

3. Each workflow must be UNIQUE - no two use cases should have identical steps.

4. Current state should emphasize manual work, bottlenecks, and pain points specific to that process.

5. Target state should show AI automation with the appropriate agentic pattern (Semantic Router, ReAct, Drafter-Critic, etc.)

6. Comparison metrics should be derived from the benefit calculations in the original report data.

Please update the workflow generator to produce these unique, contextual workflows for each use case.
